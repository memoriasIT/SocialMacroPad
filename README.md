The application Intelligent Macropad allows its users to create lists of commands which can be executed remotely.

The app strives to create a product similar to StreamDeck from ElGato or Loupedeck, but with a way lower price and with a social component which allows its users to share their "MacroPads".

It is based on Bluetooth and by using a connection to an arduino (or a similar microcontroller with HID capacities) it sends presses to the device to control it.

The possiblities are endless as you can make it do whatever you want.
